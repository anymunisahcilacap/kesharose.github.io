                <p>It is the best known example of the genus of pogona, the magnificent bearded dragon is also known as pogona vitticeps . It is an omnivorous and terrestrial animal, which enjoys the breeze in the trees. Its name comes from the prominent beard that swells at the time of mating or in the defense of its territory.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Physical appearance</h2>
<p>The bearded dragon is a lizard with a large triangular head surrounded by spiny scales. It has the ability to inflate these scales at the time you feel threatened and color them black. In addition, in the rest of the body, the bearded dragon also shows spiny scales.<br><br>In general, the males measure 60 centimeters and weigh 450 grams, they are usually somewhat larger than the females. In addition, sexual dimorphism allows us to differentiate easily: males have femoral pores within the bundles.<br><br>They can be many different colors including green, gray, brown, reddish or orange. Colors can modify them to regulate their temperature as well as to express their mood.</p>

Each case needs to be analyzed.<br><br>That's because these files are used by the browser, and by the websites, to offer more agility and better browsing experience.<br><br>Therefore, the ideal is to delete them only when your existence begins to disrupt the performance of the browser . In this way, it is recommended that the user be aware of the performance of the browser, if, as already mentioned, it is slow or if it is also crashing.<br><br>If one of these options manifests itself, clearing these files is a good idea. Incidentally, all computer cleaning should be done with caution!</p>
<h2>Who cleans the computer?</h2>
<p>Often we can not perform the necessary cleanings, either for lack of practice or even for fear of touching where we do not know.<br><br>So having a technical support is essential. A specialized support can do this cleaning and even carry out preventive maintenance so that your computer will have a much longer life.<br><br>If this is your case we advise you to find a computer technical assistance to assist you in the process.</p>

                <p>The ones that make more sense in your current reality of life! Yes that's right! There are thousands of health tips and quality of life , but not all of them are possible to achieve right away or do not fit into your life at that time. That is why you should put into practice the easiest and most meaningful ones first.</p>
<p>Only if you do this, you will already be doing a great good for your mental health, because this quest for perfection does not do well. If some health and quality of life tips can not be put into practice now, no problem, focus on what you get and what brings you well-being.<br><br>Understood this step, we can follow with some health tips and quality of life. I'll suggest five, and by the end of the reading, you can list which ones are most important and easy to put into practice, OK? No pressure!<br><br>Health Tips and Quality of Life<br>Hydrate yourself - One of the most important health and quality of life tips would be to increase water consumption, since a dehydrated body becomes weaker, confuses thirst with hunger, can "catch" the intestine etc. Buy pretty bottles, leave one in the room, one at work, one in the bag, one in the car. Try placing alarm clocks on your cell phone to remind you to drink water. Put fruit, ginger or mint in the water to make it more palatable.<br><br>Do not believe in miracles - Stop following fitness bloggers and lay people who pass on "health tips and quality of life." In addition to these people engaging in illegal activity in the profession, their information is based on Google's research and fads, and does not take into account the individual's biological individuality. And bloggers still have an aggravation, show manipulated realities that only generate frustration in those who have a "normal" life. Stop following these people, your mental health thanks.<br><br>Increase fruit consumption - As soon as you arrive from the marketplace, let the fruit be washed and cut, buy very nice little pots to carry them. Test new recipes. How about trying a new fruit a week?<br><br>Be more active - This is also one of the most important health and quality of life tips today, as sedentary lifestyle has caused more deaths than other risky habits. Use more stairs instead of elevators, use common stairs instead of moving, get off the bus one spot ahead of schedule.<br><br>Sleep longer - A body that does not rest is a body that does not work right, which saves calories by lowering your metabolism, and which increases the appetite for caloric foods in search of fast energy.</p>

                <p>A machine is a set of mobile and fixed elements whose operation makes it possible to take advantage of, direct, regulate or transform energy , or perform work for a specific purpose. is called machinery (from Latin machinarĭus ) the set of machines that apply to the same end of the mechanism that gives movement to a device.</p>
<p>In general, machines can be classified into two major categories:</p>
<p>(1) Simple machines : (2) Engines and other complex machines. Examples are pulleys that control 100 H on their strings as you will see in the image.</p>
<p>Different classifications of the types of machines can be made depending on the aspect under which they are considered. Attending to the previously described components.<br><br>These classifications are not exclusive, but complementary, so to define a certain type of machine it will be necessary to refer to the three aspects.<br><br>Another classification of the machines is their utility or use , so can be considered drills , elevators , compressors , balers , juicers , etc. The list is endless, because the human being has always pursued the design and construction of ingenios to get with them jobs that can not be done using their own strength and ability or to perform those jobs with greater comfort.<br><br>These are not all classifications, but there are others, which can be: machine, simple machine and machine as a tool.<br><br>They can also be classified by the type of flow they process: machines that process energy, machines that process materials, machines that process information.</p>

                <p>When we build or remodel, in addition to all the building material, design and hiring service providers, we have to pay attention to detail, after all, they make all the difference. A good example is the kitchen countertop, which serves as a living room / kitchen division on American kitchen models , can be used with kitchen stools, and also helps cook and support appliances.<br><br>A very common question when choosing a kitchen counter is which material is best. Each stone has its pros and cons and that's what we'll talk about here. Check out our tips and the examples of kitchen countertops we have set for you!</p>
<h2>The main kitchen countertops</h2>
<p>There are six materials that stand out when we talk about kitchen countertops: silestone , quartz, granite, corian and nanoglass. Although they are all very beautiful, features like resistance and price vary greatly.<br><br>To get the ideal stone choice you want to use on your kitchen countertop , consider how often you use the environment, what activities you will use the surface, how much you can spend, space - especially if it is a planned kitchen small - and, of course, the look you want to achieve.</p>
<h2>Silestone</h2>
<p>This type of stone is made of natural quartz, has a great variety of colors and has both hardness and strength as its great advantages. In addition, the silestone is also stain resistant, because of these characteristics is very suitable for the kitchen countertops. Its value, however, is a little salty, varying around R $ 2 thousand per m².</p>
<h2>Quartz</h2>
<p>Quartz is like a cheaper version of silestone and can give a very similar effect to the environment on a kitchen countertop. The value, however, is lower, being in the house of R $ 1 thousand.</p>
