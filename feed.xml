                <p>A machine is a set of mobile and fixed elements whose operation makes it possible to take advantage of, direct, regulate or transform energy , or perform work for a specific purpose. is called machinery (from Latin machinarĭus ) the set of machines that apply to the same end of the mechanism that gives movement to a device.</p>
<p>In general, machines can be classified into two major categories:</p>
<p>(1) Simple machines : (2) Engines and other complex machines. Examples are pulleys that control 100 H on their strings as you will see in the image.</p>
<p>Different classifications of the types of machines can be made depending on the aspect under which they are considered. Attending to the previously described components.<br><br>These classifications are not exclusive, but complementary, so to define a certain type of machine it will be necessary to refer to the three aspects.<br><br>Another classification of the machines is their utility or use , so can be considered drills , elevators , compressors , balers , juicers , etc. The list is endless, because the human being has always pursued the design and construction of ingenios to get with them jobs that can not be done using their own strength and ability or to perform those jobs with greater comfort.<br><br>These are not all classifications, but there are others, which can be: machine, simple machine and machine as a tool.<br><br>They can also be classified by the type of flow they process: machines that process energy, machines that process materials, machines that process information.</p>

                <p>When we build or remodel, in addition to all the building material, design and hiring service providers, we have to pay attention to detail, after all, they make all the difference. A good example is the kitchen countertop, which serves as a living room / kitchen division on American kitchen models , can be used with kitchen stools, and also helps cook and support appliances.<br><br>A very common question when choosing a kitchen counter is which material is best. Each stone has its pros and cons and that's what we'll talk about here. Check out our tips and the examples of kitchen countertops we have set for you!</p>
<h2>The main kitchen countertops</h2>
<p>There are six materials that stand out when we talk about kitchen countertops: silestone , quartz, granite, corian and nanoglass. Although they are all very beautiful, features like resistance and price vary greatly.<br><br>To get the ideal stone choice you want to use on your kitchen countertop , consider how often you use the environment, what activities you will use the surface, how much you can spend, space - especially if it is a planned kitchen small - and, of course, the look you want to achieve.</p>
<h2>Silestone</h2>
<p>This type of stone is made of natural quartz, has a great variety of colors and has both hardness and strength as its great advantages. In addition, the silestone is also stain resistant, because of these characteristics is very suitable for the kitchen countertops. Its value, however, is a little salty, varying around R $ 2 thousand per m².</p>
<h2>Quartz</h2>
<p>Quartz is like a cheaper version of silestone and can give a very similar effect to the environment on a kitchen countertop. The value, however, is lower, being in the house of R $ 1 thousand.</p>
