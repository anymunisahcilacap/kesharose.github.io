If you don't have it, here's a quick overview. Pandora is a free music app that allows you to create stations tailored to your favorite genre, artist or even was! Great, isn't it?<br><br>So, with this, I decided that I wanted to share some of my favorite seasons, different genres and all the jazz that (no pun intended). This may have been the hardest choice I had to make because I'm obsessed with music, and they don't necessarily have a favorite genre. I shortened my list of 13 seasons beautifully made in 5 I usually listen once or twice a week.<br><h2>1.2000 of the R&amp;B radio.</h2><br>Millennium Basic, I know, but this is by far one of my favorite stations to improvise. Whether it's cleaning, doing homework, or receding music, this season has all the music I've grown in; What is luv by Fat Joe for I'm N Luv by T-Pain (great job that censor us, mother). Listening to this station always brings many memories.<br><h2>2.90 Radio summer successes.</h2><br>This season has so many classic artists and bands, from red peppers to Coldplay to Green Day, it's as if the 90 never came out. This is my going to the station when I'm getting ready to leave, because I not only pumped for the night ahead, but singing waiting in the world to change it never seems more passionate than when I'm choosing my suit for the night. Thank you, John Mayer.<br><h2>3.90 Alternate radio.</h2><br>Every time I come across this station, I remember screaming the lyrics of Blink-182 's Adam song trying to impress my older cousins, and now these bands are some of my favorites. So many good bands populate this station; Third blind eye, Pearl Jam, Weezer, even sublime. I know, I know, sublime? Don't judge me. Globally, this is definitely a great season.<br><h2>4.60 's, 70 's and 80 radio hits.</h2><br>Yes, I know, I'm old, but who can resist a queen? or Marvin Gaye? So many of the songs in this season are classic, and clarify my mood immediately, even when I'm pressure (Get it?) This station has so much soul, you can't stop singing along legends like Stevie Wonder and Ben E. King.<br><h2>5. Radio of today's country.</h2><p><br>My basic white girl finally emerged. Yes, I love country music. I think this season captures all the best artists/bands that fall in the genre Country pop. I'm a fool for love, especially the tacky guy! This season satisfies all the desperate romantic parts of me. Sam Hunt, Brett Young, Thomas Rhett, Florida Georgia line? I don't care if I do!</p><p>Realted: <a href="https://pc-mind.com/delete-stations-pandora/">how to delete stations on pandora</a><br><br>Like Odyssey on Facebook<br><br>All in all, the music for me is just About how a song makes you feel. I'm crazy about music with soul, with purpose and with passion. I am always looking for new music, so please send some my way! I hope you enjoyed my quick synopsis of each station, make sure to give them a listen!</p><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fkesharose.tk%2F5-best-stations-on-pandora.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="http://kesharose.tk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkesharose.tk%2F5-best-stations-on-pandora.html&amp;via=Kesharose&amp;text=5%20Best%20Stations%20On%20Pandora" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="http://kesharose.tk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkesharose.tk%2F5-best-stations-on-pandora.html" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="http://kesharose.tk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkesharose.tk%2F5-best-stations-on-pandora.html&amp;media=undefined
